				<p class="p1">Lera is an emerging Ukrainian artist who goes by the alias 
				Leo Morgan. She specialises in black & white paintings. Her 
				work blends abstract and surreal art styles. 
				</p>
				<p class="p2">Lera started drawing as a child, often losing herself in her 
				sketchbooks. In her final years of high school, she began experimenting with black marker and liner. 
				Consequently, she defined herself as monochrome artist
				ever since.</p>
				<p class="p3">Lera currently exhibits her work in galleries and maintains a 
				presence on social media. She intends to continue her 
				current projects and pursuits, hoping to one day have 
				her own studio and teach.</p>
